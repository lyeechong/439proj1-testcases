439proj2-testcases
==================
test1 tests for correct behavior for the runqueue order
test2 tests for correct behavior with multiple yields
test3 tests for correct behavior with multiple yields with only one thread
test4 is a little fun. Does fibonacci numbers and squares. Tests for not corrupting the local variables on the call stack I suppose.

TODO: write cases with arguments passed to the functions
